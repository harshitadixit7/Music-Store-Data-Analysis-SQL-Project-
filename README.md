# Music-Store-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project

## About the Project  
This project analyzes data from a music store to find useful information about sales, customers, and business performance. Using PostgreSQL, I created queries to identify top customers, the best-selling music, and the most profitable regions. The goal is to help the music store improve its business.  

## Goals  
- Find top customers who spend the most money.  
- Identify the most popular music genres and albums.  
- Discover which cities and regions make the most revenue.  
- Understand customer buying habits.  

## Tools Used  
- PostgreSQL: To write queries and analyze the data.  

## Key Insights  
- Found customers who spent the most money.  
- Identified the city that generated the highest sales.  
- Discovered the most popular music genres based on purchases.  
- Analyzed customer spending patterns by gender and location.  

## How to Use  
1. Download the files from this repository.  
2. Open the SQL files in PostgreSQL or MYSQL.  
3. Run the queries on your music store database or a similar dataset to see the results.
